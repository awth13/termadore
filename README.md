# Termadore

A nod to times past, in homage to the demo scene days of the Commodore64.
Not to be taken seriously.

You are provided with a "screen" buffer based on your terminal dimensions and font size,
along with some basic drawing tools.
What will you come up with?

Plus who doesn't love a bad play on words - we adore the terminal and the commodore.
